      <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Sayleht Varela. I am a transfer student from Morton College. I am currently in my second semester at IIT. </p>
      <p>I am currently working torwards a Information Technology Management degree. I have a dog named snuggles and he is 10 years old but is still 1 in my eyes!</p>
      <p>I enjoy jigsaw puzzles and scrabble on my free time. I unfortunately do not have many hobbies but I love fashion & one day hope to make my own clothes!</p>
      <p>I love music, movies, and shows! I am currently watching Severance and I am obsessed!!</p>

	    <p><strong>FUN FACT:</strong>Virgil Abloh designed this dress and he actually received a Master degree in Architecture here at IIT and then became a very well known designer!</p>
	    <p>This is his page if you were interested in looking at his designs! He passed away and created a page where he shows all his work and gives steps on how to create your own brand!</p>
	    <a href="https://virgilabloh.com">Virgil Abloh's Webpage</a>
	    <p>Free game page is where he gives all information for those who want to start a brand!</p>

	    <p>This is one of the best looks EVER! I have seen nothing that beats this dress. It was hand crafted by one Chinese woman which took her 2 years to complete.</p>
	    <p>This dress was designed by Guo Pei.
