	  <h1>The Weeknd</h1>
	  <p>The Weeknd is one of the best artist. His discography is AMAZING! His real name is Abel Tesfaye born in Toronto, Canada. I've been listening to him since his mixtapes were on Youtube. Right now, his recent album "Hurry Up Tomorrow" which finishes the trilogy of "After Hours" & "Dawn F.M". His whole concept throughout his career was based of the darkness of Hollywood and like every artist, you are bound to grow up. But with Abel, it's not just growing up. His albums touch two worlds; one where darkness exist & another one is seeing the light after the darkness. He also has a movie coming out that unites his trilogy together which is pretty rare and cool!!</p>

	    <p>After Hours was the first album of his second trilogy. His album is based off his failed relationships, and not being able to commit but yet feels lonely. Throughtout the album he experiences feelings like loneliness, blame & guilt. He yearns for this girl who he loves and desires but knows he cannot have her because of the life that he lives</p>

	    <h2>SECOND ACT:</h2>
	    <iframe width="500" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mojMR_-Y9yE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	    <p>Dawn F.M is based off purgatory. He is stuck between the light and darkness. He feels like he cannot sacrifice the life he lives for the girl he yearns for. His song Out of Time, is about being with a girl he years for and has regrets of the love he lost. He had an opportunity to leave his Hollywood life but didn't. Jim Carrey narrates as the radio host in purgatory throughout his songs, which was pretty cool!</p>

	    <h2>FINAL ACT:</h2>
	    <iframe width="500" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Du4vvsDHQ7Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	    <p>This album came out very recently but its basically about him finally reaching the light and killing "The Weeknd", and fully emerging himself as who his mother named him to be. He reflects on all the sacrafices his mother did. He is ready to leave Hollywood behind. The first half of the album is where he is still fighting between darkness and light but then after "Big Sleep", he transcends into the light and even dedicating a song to his mother. He apologizes to her about the life that he lived.</p>
